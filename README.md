# Hey there, I'm Amir Mobayen! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my little corner of the internet. I'm a **data scientist** and **IT engineer** with a passion for using technology to solve real-world problems. I have dual masterâ€™s degrees in **Data Science** and **IT Engineering**, and I've spent years honing my skills in **machine learning**, **business intelligence**, and **data analysis**.

Whether itâ€™s developing cool system modules, building smart machine learning models, or improving platform integrations, Iâ€™m always on the lookout for innovative ways to create impact. I believe in the power of data to drive smart decisions and the importance of collaboration to bring big ideas to life.

## My Journey ðŸš€

### Education
- **EPITA** (2022 â€“ 2024): Masterâ€™s in Data Science and Analytics
- **Sharif University of Technology** (2015 â€“ 2017): Masterâ€™s in IT Engineering

### Work Experience
- **Coface** | Business Analyst (2023 â€“ 2024): I helped design and implement a search module for a large-scale agile project, and worked on API integrations to improve platform functionality.
- **J.S Benis Co.** | ML Engineer (2020 â€“ 2022): I developed an image processing prototype to improve parking management and worked on an NLP tool for online market analysis.
- **Avisa** | BI Developer (2014 â€“ 2019): I played a key role in delivering BI solutions for the National Iranian Gas Company, optimizing databases, and improving ETL processes.

## My Passions ðŸ’¡

- **Machine Learning & AI**: From scikit-learn to TensorFlow, I love making machines smarter and more capable.
- **Business Intelligence**: Helping businesses make better decisions with data is what I do best.
- **Problem-Solving**: Tackling tough challenges is what gets me excited!
  
When Iâ€™m not working with data, you can find me traveling, experimenting with photography, or playing video games (because teamwork and problem-solving go hand in hand in the virtual world too!).
