# Hobbies

Apart from my professional work in data science and business intelligence, I believe that hobbies are essential for creativity, personal growth, and developing new perspectives. Here are some of my key hobbies that influence my personal and professional life:

## Photography: Crafting Stories Through the Lens

Photography isn't just a hobby for me—it's a form of storytelling that lets me freeze emotions, moments, and narratives in time. Every time I pick up my camera, I feel a sense of excitement and responsibility to capture something that resonates, something that speaks louder than words. Photography has the unique power to convey stories that are both personal and universal, and I embrace that challenge with pride.

### Why Storytelling in Photography is Important to Me:
Through my lens, I see more than just subjects; I see stories waiting to unfold. Whether it's a fleeting smile, a breathtaking landscape, or the hustle of daily life, I aim to capture the essence of those moments. It's about freezing a point in time that sparks curiosity and emotion. With each shot, I strive to create a narrative that connects with people, makes them feel something, and invites them to see the world from a different perspective.

### The Art of Telling a Story in a Single Frame:
A photograph has the power to communicate a full story without saying a word. From the lighting to the framing, every decision matters. I take pride in the details, whether it's the warmth of sunlight during golden hour or the contrast of shadows that create drama. Every shot is a new opportunity to express creativity, but also to convey something meaningful. That’s what makes photography so exhilarating for me—it’s a perfect blend of art, precision, and emotion.

### How Photography Empowers My Work:
Photography pushes me to think creatively and look for patterns in the world around me—skills that are invaluable in data science and business intelligence. The attention to detail required for capturing the perfect image enhances my focus when working on complex systems and projects. It’s not just about snapping photos; it’s about honing my ability to observe, interpret, and translate those observations into something tangible—just like working with data.

### Photography and Personal Growth:
Photography has taught me patience, adaptability, and how to embrace the unexpected. It’s helped me appreciate the beauty in small moments and see the world through a creative lens. That same mindset carries over into my professional life, where I approach every challenge with curiosity and determination, always seeking to find the best angle—both literally and figuratively.

### My Photography Work
Below are a few of my favorite shots that illustrate my approach to storytelling through photography:

<p>Seeing a damselfly is a good sign for nature lovers! They like clean water, so their presence suggests a healthy environment nearby. Plus, their colors and movement are pretty cool to watch. Think of it as a mini high-five from nature!</p>

<p>The Sacré-Cœur Basilica is one of Paris’s most iconic landmarks, with a rich history and unique features that captivate visitors from around the world. Interestingly, the basilica’s white stone used in this building, known as travertine, exudes calcite when it rains, which acts like a natural cleaner for the structure. In other words, it cleans itself!</p>
